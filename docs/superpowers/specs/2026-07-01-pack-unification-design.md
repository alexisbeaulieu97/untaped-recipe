# Pack Unification — Design

Date: 2026-07-01
Status: approved (brainstormed and locked with Alexis)
Target release: 0.9.0 (wave 1), 0.10.0 (wave 2)
Sequencing: implementation starts only after PR #17 merges and untaped-recipe 0.8.0
publishes to PyPI, so the release pipeline is proven before this breaking wave.

## Context

untaped-recipe currently has three shareable/installable shapes — standalone recipe
projects, packs, and hook projects — each with its own library module
(`recipe_library.py`, `pack_library.py`, `hook_library.py`, ~900 LoC combined), its own
CLI namespace, and its own docs. The shapes are almost identical: a directory with a
`pyproject.toml` carrying `[tool.untaped_recipe]` metadata. The triplication makes the
tool heavier to learn, the sharing story fragmented, and the CLI surface 32 leaf
subcommands.

Separately, a hook's kind (`transform` | `validate`) is declared twice — in the hook
project manifest and in every recipe step that uses it — with a cross-check
(`ensure_hook_kind`). The manifest copy is derived metadata: the worker already
dispatches by calling the `transform()` or `validate()` function by name.

This redesign lands while the project has a single user, so breaking changes are cheap.

## Decision: everything is a pack

A **pack** is a directory whose `pyproject.toml` declares `[tool.untaped_recipe]` with
an optional `recipes` table and an optional `hooks` table. Today's three shapes become
degenerate cases: a pack of many recipes, a pack of one recipe, a pack of zero recipes
(hooks only). Single YAML recipe files remain runnable ad hoc
(`untaped-recipe apply ./recipe.yml`) but are not a library or sharing concept.

### Pack identity

Pack name = `[project].name` with the conventional `untaped-recipe-` prefix stripped
(project `untaped-recipe-ansible` → pack `ansible`). No separate name field, no
directory-name coupling. The prefix convention makes packs searchable on GitHub later.

### Manifest shape

```toml
[project]
name = "untaped-recipe-ansible"
version = "0.1.0"
requires-python = ">=3.14"
dependencies = []

[dependency-groups]
dev = ["untaped-recipe>=0.9"]

[tool.untaped_recipe]
requires_hook_api = ">=0.9,<1"

[tool.untaped_recipe.recipes]
"playbook-migration" = { path = "recipes/playbook-migration/recipe.yml" }

[tool.untaped_recipe.hooks]
"add_play_collections" = { module = "ansible_hooks.hooks.add_play_collections" }
```

- Both tables are optional and explicit. No `recipes/*/recipe.yml` auto-discovery:
  public identity comes from the manifest, and scaffolding maintains the entries, so
  the explicitness costs nothing day to day.
- Hook entries have no `kind` field (see Hook contract below).
- `requires_hook_api` gains an upper bound (`<1`) so a future breaking hook-API major
  fails loudly instead of silently passing old floors.

## Hook contract

- The exported function name is the contract: a hook module exports `transform()`,
  `validate()`, or **both**. The recipe step's `type` selects which function runs.
  Recipe-side `type` stays exactly as today — it drives the discriminated step schema
  (`transform` requires `file`; `validate` forbids it) and tells the recipe reader
  which steps mutate.
- Dual-verb hooks are first-class: validate/fix pairs share parsing logic in one
  module under one public name.
- `check` keeps its no-import guarantee: instead of comparing a declared kind, it AST-
  scans the resolved module file for `def transform` / `def validate` and rejects a
  step wired to a hook that does not export the required function. (Accepted
  limitation: dynamically defined functions are invisible to the scan; scaffolded
  hooks are flat functions and the worker fails loudly at call time.)
- `hook run` verb selection: if the module exports one function, run it; if both,
  `--file` implies transform, otherwise `--kind` is required. Error messages state
  this rule.
- Worker protocol, helpers, `--locked --no-dev` execution, and the pure-JSON boundary
  are unchanged. `HOOK_API_VERSION` bumps to `0.9.0` with this wave.

## Library

One `PackLibrary` replaces the three library modules.

- Layout: `<library_root>/packs/<pack-name>/` (installed copy of the pack directory).
- Install-source tracking lives in a library-level index, `<library_root>/packs.toml`
  (pack name → source path or git URL + rev + the pack's `[project].version` at add
  time), never in sidecar files inside pack directories — installed packs stay
  byte-identical to their source so re-sharing an edited pack never leaks library
  bookkeeping. The index is bookkeeping for a future `update` command; `update` itself
  is out of scope for 0.9.0.
- Library packs remain editable in place (parity with today's `hook edit`).

## Resolution

For `hook: set_owner` referenced by a recipe:

1. the recipe's own pack (`[tool.untaped_recipe.hooks]` in the same manifest),
2. library packs,
3. builtins (`yaml_edit` stays the only builtin; builtins remain in-process).

Recipe references in `apply` resolve against the library (bare name when unique,
`pack/name` otherwise) or a filesystem path (`./recipe.yml`, `./pack-dir` with a
qualified recipe name).

- Bare names that match more than one library pack are **errors**, listing the
  qualified candidates. Never first-match.
- Qualified syntax: `pack/name` (e.g. `ansible/add_play_collections`,
  `apply ansible/playbook-migration ./target`).

## CLI surface

The `pack` and `recipe` management namespaces disappear. Top-level verbs operate on
packs because packs are the only unit:

| Verb | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `new pack <name>` | scaffold a pack |
| `new recipe <pack>/<name>` | scaffold a recipe inside a pack, updating the manifest |
| `new hook <pack>/<name>` | scaffold a hook inside a pack, updating the manifest |
| `add <path\|git-url> [--rev R] [--name N] [--force]` | install a pack into the library |
| `remove <pack> --yes` | uninstall |
| `list [--hooks\|--packs]` | recipes by default (with source pack); hook and pack views |
| `show <ref>` | structured pack, recipe, or hook detail (see below) |
| `check [pack\|path]` | validate manifest, recipes, hook wiring (AST scan); no args = whole library |
| `edit <ref>` | open the relevant file |
| `hook run <ref> ...` | unchanged debugging verb (verb-selection rule above) |
| `apply <recipe-ref\|path> ...` | unchanged |
| `backup ...` | unchanged |

`new <kind>` is the single creation pattern, reusing qualified names. Personal one-off
hooks get no special case: make a personal pack (`new pack mine`) — it is instantly
shareable like any other.

### Structured `show`

`show` stops dumping raw file text. For a recipe it renders the description, an
inputs table (name, type, required, default, description, sensitive), a step summary,
and the hooks the recipe uses; for a hook, the exported verbs and module path; for a
pack, its recipes and hooks with one-line descriptions.
Together with the `add` confirmation this is how a user evaluates a pack someone else
shared before trusting it. (Recipe declared inputs already carry type, default,
required, description, and sensitive metadata — `show` finally surfaces them.)

### Library doctor

`check` with no arguments validates the whole library: every installed pack passes the
normal pack checks, and `packs.toml` agrees with `packs/` (an index entry whose
directory is missing, or a pack directory absent from the index, is reported). This
reuses the per-pack check machinery; it exists because manual edits under the library
root are supported (`edit`), so drift is possible.

### Structured output kinds

Unification also consolidates the emit record kinds (a breaking change for pipe
consumers, shipped with 0.9):

- Kept: `recipe.outcome`, `recipe.backup`, `recipe.hook_run`, `recipe.recipe`,
  `recipe.hook`, `recipe.pack`, `recipe.check`.
- Deleted: `recipe.pack_check` and `recipe.pack_recipe` (their commands collapse into
  `check` and `list`/`show`).

### Sharing

The unit of sharing is the pack directory. `add ./path` copies; `add <git-url>`
fetches to a temp dir and runs the same install path (one code path, two front
doors), recording source + rev in `packs.toml`. Before installing, `add` prints the
recipes and hooks the pack brings and asks for confirmation (`--yes` to skip):
installing a pack installs trusted code, and that should be visible.

## Wave 2 (0.10.0): recipe test harness

`untaped-recipe test [pack|recipe-ref]` runs golden-fixture cases that live inside
the pack:

```text
tests/<recipe-name>/<case-name>/
├── given/          # fixture target tree
├── expected/       # expected tree after apply (or expected.diff)
└── case.yml        # optional: inputs, expected verdict status/warnings
```

- Execution is **plan-only**: the planner runs against `given/`, planned changes are
  compared against `expected/` (or `expected.diff`); nothing is written.
- `--update` regenerates goldens from the current plan.
- Anti-DSL guard: cases are directories compared by content. `case.yml` carries only
  inputs and expected verdict status — no assertion language, ever. Logic in tests is
  pytest's job.
- `new hook` scaffolds a pytest that calls `transform()` directly (hooks are pure
  functions; no worker needed in unit tests).

## Wave 3: hygiene and invariants (rides along anywhere)

- Template steps gain `unknown_tokens: error | keep` (default `error`). Today unknown
  *bare* input names already fail, but non-bare `{{ ... }}` tokens (`{{ a.b }}`,
  filters) silently pass through — a trap for users expecting Jinja, yet load-bearing
  for templates that emit GitHub Actions (`${{ github.ref }}`) or Helm
  (`{{ .Values.x }}`) files. Under `error`, any `{{ ... }}` token that is not a bare
  known input name fails planning, and the error names the offending token and points
  at `unknown_tokens: keep`. Under `keep`, unknown tokens pass through verbatim while
  known inputs still render. Constraint: the renderer exists in two copies
  (`domain/templates.py` and the stdlib-only `hook_worker.py`); the change lands in
  both, pinned by a parity test.
- AGENTS.md gains permanent invariants:
  1. Control flow never enters the recipe schema; a decision is a hook.
  2. Planning is the only execution; writes are a flush of the plan buffer.
  3. No state, no inventory; targets come from arguments and pipes.
  4. Builtins stay minimal; typed uv hook packs are the extension story.
  5. The hook boundary stays pure data (stdlib-only worker, JSON protocol, no runtime
     import of untaped-recipe in hooks).
  6. Pipe composability is a protected feature: `apply --stdin` ingests untaped
     NDJSON envelopes (kind tags, `target_path`), and input `from` expressions can
     read the piped `record` — other untaped tools' output drives recipes.
- The recipe file schema stays `version: 1` in the 0.9 wave — the breaking changes
  are in manifests, the library, and the CLI, not in recipe.yml.

## Migration

Sole-user migration, no compat shims, no migration command:

- Existing library `hooks/<name>/` projects and pack/recipe entries move under
  `packs/`; hook manifests drop `kind`; `requires_hook_api` floors bump to
  `>=0.9,<1`; scaffolded dev-dep floors bump to `untaped-recipe>=0.9`.
- A short migration note in the changelog covers the manual steps.

## Non-goals

- PyPI-style pack distribution (revisit only if packs need inter-pack dependencies).
- Standalone recipe projects as a library/sharing form.
- Control flow, conditionals, or loops in the recipe schema.
- Saved-plan / state / drift semantics (plan output stays ephemeral).
- Pack `update` command (index records enough to add it later).
